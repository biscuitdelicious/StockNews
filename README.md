# StockNews

## What is the purpose of this app?

You choose a stock(Tesla in my case) and you get a message everytime the stock increased/decreased by 5%.

## Why is it that simple?

Since I'm no more a **fan of stocks/forex/cryptocurrencies**, I've decided to keep it simple. If somehow I'll have 
the idea to make it better, I'll probably look to make it web.

## How to install and use?

You need an account on [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us), [NEWS Api](https://newsapi.org/) from where you'll save your API Key.
